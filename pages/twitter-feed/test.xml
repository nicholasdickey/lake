            <title>American Thinker: The racial politics behind the teen killers in Las Vegas</title>
            <pubDate>2023-09-23T17:51:49.000Z</pubDate>  
            <description>&#60;p&#62;Two teenagers deliberately killed a retired cop while joyriding, revealing broken youth culture and racial politics behind the incident. The media hid their mugshots to avoid racial implications, but their names and eventually their photos exposed the truth. The criminal justice system also misidentified one of the teens as white instead of Hispanic. The story exposes the failures of Democrat-controlled racial policies, including the welfare system and the erasure of fathers. The refusal to take responsibility and the perpetuation of victimhood further contribute to the problem, as evident in the mothers' responses. The tragedy highlights the destructive outcome of these policies and the desire for fatherlessness, crime, and avoidance of accountability. #society #crime&#60;/p&#62;

            <pubDate>2023-09-23T17:42:20.000Z</pubDate>  
            <description>&#60;p&#62;Margaret Glaspy, a musician from Northern California, initially wanted to pursue acting but found music to be more practical. Her latest album, Echo the Diamond, returns to the direct approach of her debut album. The lyrics on the album cover a range of emotions and Glaspy believes that art becomes about something bigger than the artist. Her sound combines elements of indie rock, avant-garde, jazz, blues, and country-folk. Glaspy aims to continually evolve as a musician and is proud of her guitar lineage. #music&#60;/p&#62;

            <description>&#60;p&#62;Auto workers across the United States have initiated a strike demanding higher wages and "economic and social justice." The strike has affected numerous parts-distribution centers and facilities of Ford, Stellantis, and General Motors (#economy, #labor). President Joe Biden plans to show support for the workers by joining the picket line in Michigan, although not all workers support his involvement. Former President Donald Trump has chosen to address the workers and criticize their union leadership instead of participating in a presidential debate (#politics, #labor).&#60;/p&#62;

            <pubDate>2023-09-23T17:15:24.000Z</pubDate>  
            <description>&#60;p&#62;Actor and comedian Russell Brand is facing allegations of abusive and criminal behavior from multiple women during the period of 2006-2013. Brand denies all the allegations, but the media's sudden interest in investigating him coincides with his shift towards heterodox political positions and promotion of more honorable behavior. YouTube has already demonetized all of Brand's videos, highlighting the dangerous precedent of using allegations to silence and erase individuals in the public sphere. #society&#60;/p&#62;
